\title{Subsample rows of a matrix using hierarchical clustering}
\usage{
subset_cluster(x, k = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix whose rows will be clustered and subsampled.}

\item{k}{The number of clusters to form (default is 100).}
}
\value{
A matrix containing one representative row from each cluster.
}
\description{
This function takes a matrix \code{x} and subsamples its rows by clustering
them using hierarchical clustering. One representative row is selected
from each cluster, which helps in visualizing a large dataset in a
semi-representative way.
}
\examples{
mat <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100)
result <- subset_cluster(mat, k = 10)
dim(result) # only 10 representatives
}
