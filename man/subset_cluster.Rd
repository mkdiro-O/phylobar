\title{Subsample rows of a matrix using clustering}
\usage{
subset_cluster(x, k = 100, method = c("hclust", "medoid"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix whose rows will be clustered and subsampled.}

\item{k}{The number of clusters to form (default is 100).}

\item{method}{Clustering method to use. \code{"hclust"} (the default) uses
Euclidean distances and hierarchical clustering, selecting an arbitrary
member from each cluster. \code{"medoid"} uses Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and
K-medoids (PAM) clustering, selecting the medoid of each cluster.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing one representative row from each cluster.
}
\description{
This function takes a matrix \code{x} and subsamples its rows by clustering
them. One representative row is selected from each cluster, which helps in
visualizing a large dataset in a semi-representative way.
}
\examples{
mat <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100)
rownames(mat) <- seq_len(100)
result <- subset_cluster(mat, k = 10)
dim(result) # only 10 representatives

# Using Bray-Curtis + K-medoids (better for compositional data)
counts <- matrix(rpois(1000, 5), nrow = 100)
rownames(counts) <- seq_len(100)
result2 <- subset_cluster(counts, k = 10, method = "medoid")
