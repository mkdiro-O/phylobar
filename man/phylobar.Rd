\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of abundances. Samples along rows, features along columns.}

\item{tree}{An object of class phylo, representing the tree structure.}

\item{hclust_order}{Logical; if TRUE, reorder rows/columns by hierarchical
clustering.}

\item{palette}{Character vector of colors for stacked bars. If NULL, uses
default palette: c("#9c7bbaff", "#6eb8acff", "#ce7b7bff", "#7b9cc4ff",
"#c47ba0ff", "#e1d07eff").}

\item{width}{Width of the widget in pixels. If NULL, uses window default.}

\item{height}{Height of the widget in pixels. If NULL, uses window default.}

\item{sample_font_size}{Font size for sample labels (integer).}

\item{sample_label_margin}{Margin between sample labels and bars in pixels.}

\item{sample_label_space}{Space allocated for sample labels in pixels.}

\item{sample_magnify}{Magnification factor for hovered sample labels.}

\item{sample_show_all}{Logical; if TRUE, show all sample labels.}

\item{element_id}{Optional HTML element ID to attach the widget to.}

\item{rel_width}{Width of the tree panel relative to the overall
visualization. Defaults to 0.4.}

\item{rel_height}{Relative height of the tree in the overall visualization.
Defaults to 0.85. Adjust this if you need more/less space for the legend.}

\item{rel_space}{Space between tree and barplot panels in pixels.}

\item{legend_mode}{Logical; if TRUE (default), display labels for the painted
subtrees in a legend near the bottom of the tree.  If FALSE, include the
labels within the tree itself.}

\item{legend_x_start}{Horizontal starting position (in pixels) for the
legend. Defaults to 4.}

\item{legend_spacing}{Vertical spacing (in pixels) between legend entries.}
}
\value{
An htmlwidget visualization attached to the element element_id on
the output HTML page.

\description{
\code{phylobar} is a visualization package that makes it possible to construct a
stacked barplot by interactively "painting" an associated tree. This is an
alternative to defining a color palette using a fixed taxonomic resolution.
It also helps avoid the issue of grouping all rare taxa into a color for
"other" since species can be chosen selectively, we can paint a few rare taxa
but not the rest.
