The Human Intestinal Tract (HITChip) Atlas dataset is a widely used reference 
for studying variation in the gut microbiome across diverse individuals. 
The dataset is available in the microbiome package as atlas1006, and
includes microbial abundances along with metadata such as extraction method,
subject information, and taxonomic annotations.

In this vignette, we demonstrate how to use phylobar to create
phylogeny-aware visualizations of the atlas data. We will walk through tree
construction, highlight potential pitfalls in taxonomic labeling, and generate
visualizations that summarize variation across samples.

```{r load-libs}
library(ape)
library(phylobar)
library(microbiome)
```

# Setup
We begin by loading the mouse diet study data, which is stored remotely and 
can be loaded into R as a phyloseq object.

```{r download-data}
data(atlas1006)
pseq3 <- atlas1006 |>
    subset_samples(DNA_extraction_method == "r") |>
    transform(transform = "compositional")
```

Next, we load the atlas1006 dataset. For simplicity, we focus on samples
with the r DNA extraction method and transform abundances into compositional
form (so each sample sums to 1).

```{r}
tree <- taxonomy_to_tree(tax_table(pseq3))
checkValidPhylo(tree)
```

A naive attempt to build a taxonomy-based tree can fail, because duplicate names
across different levels of the taxonomy may result in loops. To address this, we 
add level-specific prefixes (e.g., p_ for phylum, f_ for family), ensuring that 
ancestor and descendant nodes have unique labels.

```{r}
taxa <- tax_table(pseq3)
taxa <- cbind(Kingdom = "Bacteria", taxa)
taxa <- add_prefix(taxa)

tree <- taxonomy_to_tree(taxa)
checkValidPhylo(tree)
```

With a valid tree and abundance matrix, we can generate a phylobar plot.
Here, samples are arranged along the x-axis, with stacked bars representing
taxonomic abundances, aligned with the corresponding branches of the tree.

```{r}
x <- t(otu_table(pseq3))
phylobar(x, tree, sample_show_all = FALSE, rel_width = 0.2)
```

Because the full dataset is complex, we can simplify the visualization by
subsampling representative samples. This preserves the main conclusions
while reducing visual clutter.

```{r}
x_sub <- subset_cluster(x)
x_sub <- x_sub[, colSums(x_sub) > 0]

leaves_to_keep <- intersect(tree$tip.label, colnames(x_sub))
filtered_tree <- drop.tip(tree, setdiff(tree$tip.label, leaves_to_keep))
phylobar(x_sub, filtered_tree)
```

# Interpretation

There are many interesting patterns in the atlas dataset revealing distinct patterns
in the human intestinal. For example, Enterobacter aerogenes appears across
a broad range of samples, but generally at low relative abundance. Only one sample 
shows notable representation, creating a narrow band in the stacked barplot. This patchy
distribution is a characteristic of opportunistic or conditionally rare taxa, which may be
present in many individuals but rarely dominate the community structure. Such patterns
have been previously been described as examples of bimodal or "tipping element" behavior, 
where a taxon is abundant in some hosts but nearly absent in others (Lahti et al. 2014).

Next, this screenshot highlights the dominance of Firmicutes (yellow) and Bacteroidetes
(purple) in the human gut microbiome. While these two phyla are prevalent across nearly
all samples, their relative proportions vary widely. Some samples are Firmicutes-dominant,
while others are Bacteroidetes-dominant. This variability reflects the complex interplay
of host genetics, diet, and environmental factors that shape the gut microbiome.
